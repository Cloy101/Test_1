The app "Test_1" was written to demonstrate my skills in creating a C++ application as per the task requirements.
What is the app do?
1. Take the PostgresQLS database server connection setup from config.json
2. Create a connection, send the query to the server and take the all public tables from the PostgresSQL database
3. Putt all the data to the file output.json

To get good results you need to install the PostgresSQL library on your machine and change either the connection settup of your locak PostgresSQL server or the connection data in config.json toward the configuration of your machine
